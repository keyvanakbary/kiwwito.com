One common issue in Symfony 2 projects is that the "app/cache" and "app/logs" directories must be writable both by the web server and the command line user. On a UNIX system, if your web server user is different from your command line user, you can run the following commands just once in your project to ensure that permissions will be setup properly. Change "www-data" to the web server user and "yourname" to your command line user.

### 1. Using ACL on a system that supports chmod +a
Many systems allow you to use the "chmod +a" command. Try this first, and if you get an error - try the next method:

    rm -rf app/cache/*
    rm -rf app/logs/*


    sudo chmod +a "www-data allow delete,write,append,file_inherit,directory_inherit" app/cache app/logs
    sudo chmod +a "yourname allow delete,write,append,file_inherit,directory_inherit" app/cache app/logs

### 2. Using Acl on a system that does not support chmod +a
Some systems don't support "chmod +a", but do support another utility called "setfacl". You may need to <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions#ACLs">enable ACL support</a> on your partition and install "setfacl "before using it (as is the case with Ubuntu), like so:

    sudo setfacl -R -m u:www-data:rwx -m u:yourname:rwx app/cache app/logs
    sudo setfacl -dR -m u:www-data:rwx -m u:yourname:rwx app/cache app/logs

### 3. Without using ACL
If you don't have access to changing the ACL of the directories, you will need to change the "umask" so that the cache and log directories will be group-writable or world-writable (depending if the web server user and the command line user are in the same group or not). To achieve this, put the following line at the beginning of the "app/console", "web/app.php" and "web/app_dev.php" files:

{% highlight php startinline %}
umask(0002); // This will let the permissions be 0775

// or

umask(0000); // This will let the permissions be 0777
{% endhighlight %}
