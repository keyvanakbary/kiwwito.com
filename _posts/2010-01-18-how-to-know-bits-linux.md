Sometimes is useful to know what is our installed arquitecture, we might installed a 32 bits Ubuntu in a 64 bits computer arquitecture.
For know our Linux arquitecture we only have to execute the next command:


    uname -m

If the response is "x86_64" our Linux is a 64 bits system, otherwise (i686) is a 32 bits.
