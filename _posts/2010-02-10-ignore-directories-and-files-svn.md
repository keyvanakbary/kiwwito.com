Ignore files or entire directories is easy as executing the next line:


    svn propedit svn:ignore ./DIRECTORY_OR_FILE_TO_IGNORE

At this moment, the default editor will be opened waiting to introduce the files or directory filenames that we want to ignore, we can ignore all files inserting a:

    *

or we can ignore specific filenames:

    *_dev.php
    *.jpg
