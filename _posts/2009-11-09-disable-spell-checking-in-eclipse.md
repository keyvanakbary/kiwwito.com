In a new instalation of Eclipse IDE, the spell checking in the comments that we insert into our code (normally Java) its enabled by default. This slows down the writing and usually bothers because we use specific words or we have not installed our language package.

**For disabling spell checking:**
Window->Preferences :: General->Editor->Text Editors->Spelling
Now, uncheck the box "Enable spell checking"
