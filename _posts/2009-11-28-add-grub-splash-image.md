Changing or setting an image to GRUB is trivial. For it we need install two tools of our linux environment:

`convert` Useful tool for image process (format, size, etc.).

`startupmanager` Graphical Grub manager.

### Selecting the image
Look for the image that you want to be the GRUB background. Is not necessary search for a specific format, size or color deep.

### Convert the image into a new GRUB compatible one
The images that can be GRUB backgrounds must have a concrete format, size and color deep. For transforming the image to a new compatible one, you can use the convert tool as:

    convert image.jpg -resize 640x480! -colors 14 -depth 8 image.xpm.gz

### Configure GRUB with the new image
Once we have the compatible image, we have to set it as the default GRUB background with `startupmanager`.
