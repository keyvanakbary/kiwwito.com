If we choose another DocumentRoot location for any host configuration you must ensure that Apache have full access from the root to the destiny if not your browser will prompt a "Permission denied" and in the log file you can find a message like `Permission denied: NO_ACCESIBLE_DIR/.htaccess pcfg_openfile: unable to check htaccess file, ensure it is readable`

We can solve this problem setting a correct access permissions from the root to the destiny path. For example if we have a non accesible or a `DocumentRoot` `/var/www` problem we can solve it setting a `/var` and `/var/www` **755** permissions:

    chmod 755 /srv
    chmod 755 /srv/www
