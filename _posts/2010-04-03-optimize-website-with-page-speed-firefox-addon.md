If you want to know how you can optimize or speed up your server page response, you can use the incredibly useful tool "page speed" of Google.

First, we must have installed Firefox with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-EN/firefox/addon/1843">Firebug addon</a> installed. Once done, we only have to install <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/en-EN/speed/page-speed/download.html">"page speed" addon</a> and start optimizing.
